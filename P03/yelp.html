                <p>The compare feature is designed, to ultimately assist the users main goal- to decide where to go. Due to the abundance of information that is provided within the search results, the user is required to remember where each business was in the results.

                <p>
                    As a user of Yelp, conducting interviews allowed me to see past my own bias to expand our understanding of other users’ challenges. Enabling me to investigate and design to solve other user’s challenges within the app, rather than my own. Working under a time constraint allowed us to gather important information quickly. We learned to reject good ideas that did not fit within the scope, allowing us to consider all possibilities before choosing the right one.
