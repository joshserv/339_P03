                </p>
                <p>We looked into beginner and expert users to understand when and why they use the app. Through interviews, we recognized that majority of users spent most of their time deciding on where they should go.

                <p>Conducting exploratory and evaluative research to find usability issues, we found two major concerns that the users encountered. We decided to focus on our first concern, which addresses the issue of excessive information that yelp provides, particularly within the search process.

                <p>The compare feature is designed, to ultimately assist the users main goal- to decide where to go. Due to the abundance of information that is provided within the search results, the user is required to remember where each business was in the results. The compare feature assists the user as it allows them to select their desired businesses and view them together in a separate location.

                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>
                    As a user of Yelp, conducting interviews allowed me to see past my own bias to expand our understanding of other users’ challenges. Enabling me to investigate and design to solve other user’s challenges within the app, rather than my own. Working under a time constraint allowed us to gather important information quickly. We learned to reject good ideas that did not fit within the scope, allowing us to consider all possibilities before choosing the right one.
